We are as team Shawarma dedicated to creating epic entertainment experiences of retro games starting with a fun revamp of the old school game brick breaker.

Keyboard as the old school controller and the old school display you can clealy see pixels are our lovely friends during this adventure so keep them close.

We value our users as providing them up-to-date features which are not in the base version of the game such as a personal account to save games, new allies and enemies in the gameplay such as aliens. If cracking bricks, exploding mines, and cooperating with aliens are exciting for you, you are in the right place.
